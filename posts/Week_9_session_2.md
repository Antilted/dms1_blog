# Introduction
Basically this session is this just for us the play each others games. I wasn't able to upload an improved version of my game so i instead uploaded a draft version it still has the copyright sounds. I was able to give feedbacks for others in class as well

# Mopa's game

Overall i think the game has a really nice concept which aim for you to go out and explore stuff on your own maybe this is what he consider as an ecounter. For me i really like the fact that the game has so mant ways that the player can interact with the things in the game. The only thing i would consider is the layout is kinda messy and unclear maybe thats the only problem. Great game 4/5 stars

# Alyanna's game

Really tells a story of how a student from home and just in a flash into a brand new place with an unfamiliar sight. Really love how she puts the layout and composition of everything together thats what i really want to see. Personally i would love to see more larger type of encounter. Bloody good effor 4/5 stars

# Thi's game

So bascically the game firsts puts you inside the maze which i really like cause its gives you a challenge first. The part where you get to the door and into the gallery is sorta unclear but good concept. ALso the mirror effect at the end seems like you have reached your goal is pretty nice. Maybe add collision because i fell down many times. Good effort overall 3.5/5 stars

# An's game

This game here i really like cause they story is clear like from middle school to uni to your dream is really thought out quite carefully. She also added the collecting stars at the end which is like reaching your dreams and especially the sound effects for each part fits perfectly. Highly liked by me 4.5/5 stars

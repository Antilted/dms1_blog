# Introduction

Today we were presented with a new yet oddly familiar web based design program which is Figma. We did not get into Figma in the class too much this time but more rather than answering or planning the answers and questions for our web. In this lesson a bunch of self reflection questions were handed out and this is probably really setting us up for the final assingment.

# Reflection

By this i was taught how to reflect upon what i've done in my past work and how i view them now. I was tasked to peform a critical self reflection on my few lasts assingment and think about how i've done, what are the things that stand out and the mistakes that i wish i could improve on or rather fix. This is rather not unusual because i've been doing the blog which also counts as self-reflection so all the data or old work can be used and mentioned again in this assingment.

# Evaluating my work

Here Mr.Thomas talked us through how evaluating our own work or let others evaluate can really help widen our view about the elements in the work. This specific form of anylisis aims to help me improve my future projects as well as see the mistakes that might appeal to others and not to me. The best way to evaluate is to have someone else judge your work so they could point out what seems to be not right so that we could remove it or better refine the project.

# Assignment 1

Here I got a blast in the past with the first assignment and Mr.Thomas has prepared some questions so that we could answer but I would like just to go over everything as a brief because some things said might be repetitive and long

Basically i just planned out a specific and consistent vibe that goes thorughout in my video which is a calm and peacful vibe because when i first arrived in Melbourne everything seems to be very calm not much busy and noisy things happening at that time. Coming from that I basically chose and compose a few songs that screams chill and calm mood. As for the visual compoments basically I just try to get a good lighting in the scene and try to mix between a warm and cold tone.

The footage are also puposely filmed like a vlogging style to give the audience a sense of friendliness and amatuer from me yet this still gives out a good amount of information for the people watching my video. The footage are linked together through footsteps scenes as i want to showcase a meaning of the steps of my journey. 

The editing technqiues used in my video are mostly light leaks that matches the clip and to add a more vibrant feel to it. Also I've tested some opacity overlays between some different clips to give a more pressurized feeling while watching for the audience. 

For sounds i bascially just use two audio source because I could just cut out some parts in the audio and just mix match them under the video so that they fit and clearly describe what's going on.

# Assignment 2

For this specific assingment I specifically chose the two prompts which is Growth & System as i wanted to design Pokemon evolutions for my project. The reason I chose this theme is that personally i really like Pokemon so i wanted to make icons for them, that I believe lead me to choose those two prompts mentioned before. 

I planned to take a look at some of the references and try to do the design in an 8-bit type style. I decided to the blue theme also known as water types so that the icons have a cohesive design through out the assingment. I first planned and sketch the outline inside of Aseprite then I import the design into Illustrator and start stacking shapes from there.

For sounds i basically just take the sounds that is already there in the game and just import it into my project as i believe they fit perfectly. 

# Assignment 3

When presented with this project I needed to really put an effort into this because Im not really familiar with 3D design and scripting in general. I first took a look at some ideas and I have decided to do a chase gameplay style through out my entire game. For me terraining is the easiest because most of my scenes will be mountain terrains, texturing is not that big of a problem because I was able to find a very good asset pack on Unity store for ground textures. Adding little details such as fog, skybox, trees and other vegetations is a little time consuming because they can't just be spammed everywhere and still look good like painting textures.

Finding the right 3D models and writing a good script for the behaviors proves to be the hardest and time consuming thing for this project. The problems with the models are sometimes they are broken and cannot be imported, another big problem is that the models are rotated or positioned in a way that doesn't fit the default axis of Unity which leads to further problem in scripting. I had to try making some models walk backwards to make it seem like they are moving forward because of the wrong axis and also I had to add more elements into the player scirpt that was provided by Mr.Thomas to make the player have a more free range of control.

# Assingment 4 status

In this assingment I'm leaning towards a more minimalistic style which minimal words and mostly pictures to show my progress. The main color for my web design would be black with little blurred out colors to give a spot for my other elements to standout. The website will mainly be talking about how i did my projects and a brief describtion of my assingments. Right now nothing much is going on but I will put in a bit more effort on how to place and composite my website further on.

Thats all for today

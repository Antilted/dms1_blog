# Introduction

Today, ive got the chance to learn about space as a void. This concept that mr Thomas taught us is about how different styles and different views we have gives an impact on us. Spaces can become unique when it has an agenda or concept to it, this meaning the interiror or exteriror design also the colors and what we fill the void with can give us a clear definition of what a unique space can be. We also discuss about the parallax design meaning a mesh put together but when we looked at it in the right angle than it becomes something.

# Euclidean space

The meaning of this is when a space is divided into 3 different types x, y, z. The reason i think we are going over this so we could have a better sense of how designing in 3D work and how people would react when they experience it. By introducing this Euclidean space to us is like giving us the fundamental basic to 3D design.

# Ma

Originating from Japan and by having a similar meaning to Euclidean space meaning a space between two things. This concept actually allows me to further think about how i would implement it into my project. This Ma spacing concept got me thinking about how i could place elemts across from each other to see how they would work with the scene.

# Spatial composition

Here i got the chance to learn how just by placing shapes in the right angle i was able see how big of a difference it can make to a plain composition. The thing is it doesn't have to be really detailed and complex it just have to be visually appealing. I was also able to see that how the object of a space be decieve the naked eye of a person, what i mean to say is that the composition is made and placed exactly into the lens so it would give out a certain vibe or mood

# Character controller

Here in Unity i was able to download and experience a prototype of a moving character. I can use the basic control of W,A,S,D to move around but only at a certain speed. This allows me to get a grasp of the preview of what others would see when they experienced my scene. I was supposed to remove the main camera thats is provided defautly by Unity because the player or character controllers already has a camera of its own, in addition i could freely change the sensitivity and camera angle and the position so i could spawn my character anywhere i want.

# Spacial Encounters

Here i was taught the concept of spacial encounters where the scene needs to set a vibe and an expectation of what is going to happen in an encounter. This got me thinking about what i was going to do in my 3D scene, this means that i have to make the the physics, lighting and collision to be on the spot. Settings will have to give an effect that immediately sets and expextation for it.

# Terrain tools

Inside of Unity i first got the chance to interact with the terrain tool. To add the terrain you need to right click on the hierarchy panel and add the terrain this would generate a large scale untextured platform with a terrain collider added in it by default.

# Raise and lower terrain

Inside of the inspector panel we can raise and lower terrain. There are many types of brushes or style that is included in the selection panel, there we an adjust the size and the opacity aka how strong it is. From there i could create a simple looking terrain like this

# Paint terrain

Here we can export a texture and use a paint tool to paint the terrain that we have. The behavior is similar to what you would expect. We can adjust size and opacity to our liking and also we could add multiple layers as well. Heres what i did

# Set Height 

By using set height we could create a flat ground on the terrain inside of Unity. Do keep in mind that this tool is very hard too use for beginner, i was struggling with this a bit in class but than i figure out how it works. Here's what i did to the terrain.

# Assingment 3 status
 Here i've got a clear idead what im going to do. Things are still quite ambitious and may change but heres what i've plan out

 Starting scene: Here im planning to make a long walk way up to the mountain where you would be able to teleport to different places in this case scenes. The top of the mountain will be flat and will have a Japanese vibe to it, there will temples aka my 3D models. I plan to use 3-4 3D models in this scene as becuase i want a hook and not let the player get bored of nclimbing the mountain. 

 Deinophobia: I have always wanted to replicate one of my favorite dinosaur game "jurassic park operation genesis" in this case i've made a chase scene where the player has to run away from the dinosaur before it eats you. The scene will the set in a jungle type island and im planning to use 2 3D models for this particular scene. After you made it to the portal you will teleported to the next scene

 Thalassophobia: Here im trying out some water mechanics as well as boat physics. This would be set at night time in a thunder storm. I dont know how the coding would work for these mechanics yet but i will try. Same situation as the first one but this one the shark doesnt eat you its mainly the ocean sounds and scene that does that part. 

 Phasmophobia: This scene im trying to make a maze where you have to find an exit before a monster comes and kill you. Im planning to use around 4 3d models in this scene right here. The ghost will mainly be moving statically with scary noises alerting you before it chases you down. After escaping you will get teleported back to the starting scene where you can embrace the beautifull view again. 

 Thats all for today

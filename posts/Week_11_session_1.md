# Introduction

Today we dive deeper into the aspects of wireframing in Figma web designs, basically wireframing is like to make a layout of template for the web. By this we can make many prototypes and adjust before placing the components in, by doing this we can avoid design mistakes as everything is already planned out. After learning wireframing basics, we were task to make a few wireframe web templates so can later adjust them to out liking and use it as out main design.

# Basics of wireframing

So I learned that wireframing is just like making a prototype for something like how I can see the wires in 3D models back in the Unity assignment. Wireframing here is just for us to place shapes or frame for some components and layout our ideas like sketching and makeing a storyboard.

# How shapes and layout matters

Here the style and amount of shapes we choose matters, because if we want a minimalistic style the amount of shapes should have a limited amount and their complexity shouls be the same. In contrast, in a maximalistic we should have a large amount of shapes and shapes that looks really complex or messy, by doing this I believe that this really gives off an impression right away for the audience.

# Scaling

It is important that your web should be viewable on many platforms such as: desktop, mobile, tablet, etc. The simplest way is to make a layout or wireframe for your devices on a different scale, then you should be able to create the components needed for the web. Another way is very hard to do which is making the web itself responsive, what I mean is that when you change the window size for example in desktop view the layout of your web changes aswell, personally I really want to have this feature for my web but this is really hard to pull off for me.

# Assignment 4 status

Right now I've finished doing my answers and making text for the web design, I think I chose a mixture between the first and third template as both or sort of minimalistic. I've also decided to by the dev package to furthuer enhance to aesthetic of my web or just too make it look a bit more neat. Here are the three sample wireframe layout that I've made

I tried going for a light theme at first but again like Discord's light mode it hurts my eyes, especially when i do most of my work at night time so black is what i chose.

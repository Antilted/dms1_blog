# Introduction

Today, unfortunetly Mr.Thomas wasn't able to teach us face to face in class due to having some sort of eye problem. Instead, the class was taught on Discord. Not much is taught today as we are apporching the end of the semester, still we learned about how to share our prototype for others to view it.

# Sharing 

In Figma when you press the preview button it opens up a new tab that shows you your actual web page. There should be a bar that appears on top showing a share prototype option and from that you could share your web page with anyone.

# Classmates review

I got the chance to review and give feedback to Mopa's web, I could say that his web has a lot of bright colors and it really shows personality and also i would suggest organizing the components a bit and not let it look messy.

# Assingment 4 status

Right now I think I have completed my entire Figma web just maybe I could add more information.

Everything is layed out in a clear way and I tried to keep the amount of text and pictures to the minimum so that everything fits well together.

Thats all for today

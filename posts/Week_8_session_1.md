# Introduction

Today i have got the chance to learn about Guiding Navigations, this lesson here is about how you want to lead the player into a certain pathway that can massivley impact the player. Mr Thomas introduced about space but in different way this time. Its all about the way you design the entrance and pathway that will greatfully give off an impression to who is entering.

# Space, Entrance and orientation

For space another important thing rather than the actual main GameObject itself is rather the skybox and the elements that sets up the expectation and vibe for what the player would expect. Another important consideration is that the area or specifically the entrance needs to be accessible so that the player can enter. Also clues are also another crucial part that also sets as a compliment for the object.

# Entrance 

Besides the exterior background and supporting elements the setting of the entrace is also vital to the contrbution to composition of the scene. After hearing a brief explanation i realised that the entrance can vary from underwaterwater to insides of mountains. The entrance is a particular and distinct Object that can be differentiate quite easily from the others, the most notable is the color and size this can definetly hook the player into coming into it like a grand entrance.

I really like this entrance right because it gives out a powerful impression, looking so strong and steady is giving me a war theme was going on here

# Orientation

The way that the GameOject is displayed and placed also matters, lets say that if you want to keep your scene hidden for a little bit you would place your GameObjects facing away and not revealing anything that would give away the intention immediately. On the other hand if you want to let the impact flow through the player you would place it so that the player would recognize and be blown away immediately. By understnading this i could make my project to be more visually appealing rather than just plain and boring look to it. 

# Path

This particular element is one of the thing that makes up a good scene. By having a navigable and clear path it could lure the playes into following maybe lets say if you want to lead the player into a scene or you could trick the player into an element of suprise like a trap lets say. 

There are actually 3 main types of paths: Straight, oblique and spiral
Straight paths tend to be more direct and the player can really expect what is going on because its easy the follow. This could let the player experience a lot things when going through it.

Oblique paths are paths that are windier than usual this allows the player to have more time taking on what ever the editor throws at them. As for the editor, they can have a more diverse and less restricted way of playing around with GameObjects 

Spiral paths are paths said to lead to an unexpected encounter usually with high intensity or anxiety involved. Editors usually use spiral paths to make the scene more admirable as it takes a longer time for the players to navigate through spiral path rather than the usual straight and oblique path

# Way finding 

Here Mr Thomas sets me up with a way finding activity. Here he told us to go to Assembly which a lovely coffee shop, we were allowed to use google maps inside the classroom at first then we must use other elements or landmarks that can help us navigate to the destination. We then eventually found the cafe and i got a Flatwhite because its better than Latte. Here's how it went

I would personally say that this was a thrill of an activity because expolration is always interesting and fun to take part in

# Assingment 3 status

So as i said in the last session that the lobby/mountain would be Japanese themed but then i scrapped it and decided to go with on ancient ruin scene instead because i believe its easier to get better lighting and Japanese requires way more 3D model than i expected. And also i have not decided to make a gray box scale because Unity crashes and bugs out when there are multiple scenes on there. The ideas for teleporting the player into different phobia is still being worked on. SO heres the proccess.

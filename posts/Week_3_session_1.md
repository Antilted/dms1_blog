# Discussion

My self portrait video consists of going to different places mostly wildlife and dinosaurs. The reason for this is that im an international student and ive just been in Melbourne for less then a month before i started going to RMIT. The way i want to portray this idea to my audiences is that i have to set my video at a calm moody style because my personality is a chill guy. Also conveying to todays lesson, the sound techniques i will use is the j and L techniques, i believe will set the right mood for the match cuts i put in the video.

# Introduction

It's getting to the finalisation of all of our assignments. Today not much is learned but they're still vital and important. We were introduced the web publisher which allows us to build and publish web onto the Unity website for playing.

# Web pubsliher

Here this web publisher thing is an additional asset or addon the must be downloaded in the Unity registery section like this

After we download the asset we must click on Publish->WebGl project->Build and run. This i learned might take a while because of the amount of rendering through 3D models and scripts. I've also learned that you can adjust the settings of the build in the Player settings. 

# On web

Here we should select a folder preferably an empty one away from the main C:Drive and put the project in there as it may take up a long time to finish building. After it finishes building it should open your default browser lets say Google to Unity play website. There we should upload out Build in a Zip file and give it a name and a brief description, thumbnail and preview video is optional. From there i've play tested my game and realised that the one on Unity play presented an awful lot more bugs than the one in the editor especially the shading and color integrading so i had to make a few adjusments in the Editor place in order to make the game more appealing.

This is my cousin when i sent him my link to play the game, he's already playing a game so he speed runned it abit. After that he said that the game concept is pretty good and creative, he also metioned about the texture needs a bit reworking but its nice and he also told me to make the ghost to be less buggy.

# Assignment 3 status

So ive basically finished the assingment just some more fixing to do. There's also a bug that spawns another and it flies out, i find this bug not really major but it ruins the aesthetic of the game. I couldn't fix the bug tho so i kept it as a feature like when your dead one of your lives goes to heaven. The final part which is the ghost part was really good in my opinion because the rotation axis of the model i used is all messed up and can't be change so i had to spend a lot time doing the script. So here are some of the final shots

# Main scene

This scene has the most 3D models and the most texture painting this scene first caused me alot of problem because i dont know how to do something terraining at first but it turned out great.

# Scene_2

This scene is basically the scene that i tackled with scripts a lot because the axis are all inverted and the good dinosaur models all caused a lot of money. Still managed to pull it all together with the concept of dinosaur chasing i personally think this scene is my favorite from the texturing to sound design.

# Scene_3

This scene i decided to go a little minimalistic with just 2 islands and a shark chasing while your on a boat. If the shark gets you u die. I also added the underwater blurry vision as well to mimic the realistic effect i wished that Unity allowed to me use more assets because the old version has more avaiable. Oh i have also decided to make the portal is this scene to be more broken and not working because this has been corroded and worn down m=by wind and ocean waves.

![scene_3](w9s1/scene_3.jpg)

# Scene_4

This scene i've decided to go with the concept of ghost chasing you they will wander around and when u get close they attack you. The ragdoll sound i've decided to give the ghost when they touch you is intentional because it takes like 2 seconds to respawn and the ghost kind wiggle when they touch you, i think of this a comedic element to make you less afraid.

Thats all for today

Text also matter because it gives out what we are trying to say, texts needs to be clearly visible in order for the others to read and understand whats going on, aesthetic comes next because you need to match the style of your text to the web design your doing or else it would stand out in an unusual way.

# Grid system

By using the grid it allows us to correctly place what we want in the web with the perfect scale, the grid also helps us to plan out the wireframing for other devices as well so we could layout our content across a variety of webpages without having them clash with each other.

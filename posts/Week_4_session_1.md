# Discussion

Throughout my design approach, I made a concerted effort to incorporate each stage of design thinking to ensure that the final product was both user-centered and effective. I began by empathizing with people, conducting interviews and observations to properly grasp their wants, frustrations, and ambitions. This allowed me to obtain great insights and understand the problem from their perspective.

Next, I proceeded to the define stage, where I consolidated the material obtained to produce a clear and short problem description. This helps to focus the project on a genuine user need rather than preconceptions.

During the ideation phase, I brainstormed a variety of potential solutions, promoting creativity and open-minded thinking. I investigated both traditional and out-of-the-box options before narrowing down the most intriguing objectives.

With a few strong ideas selected, I built quick, low-fidelity prototypes to visualize and communicate potential solutions. These prototypes made it easier to spot strengths and weaknesses early on without investing too many resources.

Finally, I moved into the test phase by sharing my prototypes with users and gathering feedback. This step was crucial in identifying what worked, what didnâ€™t, and what needed improvement. I used this feedback to iterate and refine the design for a better outcome.

Each step of the process was intentional and helped shape a solution that was rooted in real user needs.

# Introduction 

Today, DMS1 introduced a completely new app called Unity, in which i've always thought of it as to be based more in the Game Design course. Still im intrigued and excited to find out what Unity could offer. From what i've heard the design system and interface is similar to Blender and Maya, from that i think its quite reseonable that this is included in the course.

# Diccusion

After installing Unity, i was first met with a problem in which we must locate and download an editor for unity. Personally i think it's really weird that you must download an editor and why it's not already included in it. Mr.Thomas then asked us to choose the 3D render pipeline project which at first seems really complex as i've not used too much 3D design app so its still very new and unfamiliar looking to me. 

# Interface

First, theres the scene view in the middle from which you can move around freely and see your scene composition. Meaning that this allows the editor to visually arrange and edit objects in the game. Also same as in many other 3D editing app you can move, rotate, scale objects; navigate through the world like a 3D modeling tool. There's also a game view from which you can come in an experineced what you have just made, this view follows the Main Camera.

# Main Camera Tool

From what i've experienced from other apps the main camera in Unity is similar as it lets you view your main scene in the game view. You can also adjust the position, rotation and scale in a 3D axis form. There is also a FOV which can let you change the radius of your camera to fit the scene. Thomas also metioned about how we could attached or make a script for the camera so that it could become the character's view but that's for the next class.

# Hierarchy Panel

The Hierarchy panel is a place where you can view what objects you have placed into the scene. The purpose is basically just to display all GameObjects in the current scene in a tree structure. You can also organize and arrange mutiple of your layers in the hierarchy panel. There you can add and group the GameObjects all together so that you can edit and change their values in the Inspector panel on the right hand side.

# Inspector Panel

After selecting what GameObjects you want to edit the properties on you can go to the Inspector panel. In this area you can change the basic position, rotation, scale of any object. In addition, you can add texture by creating a material in the Project panel and add them to what ever the object is you want. Theres also an add component option in which you can add physics to your 3D objects or Colliders so that the player you are going to build is not going to phase through them. Another important thing is that you can add Scirpts, this was not taught at class yet but i did went home and tested a few things out. Apparently you need to link a coding extension or interface to it. Microsoft Visual Community is what i chose as because its chosen by many other editors/programmers.

# Class activity 

We were explained the fundamental basics about Unity from how to add an object or basic shapes in this case and how to import texture and add them to the object. I learned first by creating a material and importing a texture to it thourgh th Albedo option in the inspector panel. Then i just dragged the texutre to the object, there's also options to materialize the texture such as: cast shadows, Metallic, etc. The activity was the recreate the solar system, i had a bit of trouble getting the texture in is it keeps turning pink but after a while i was able to get texture because the problem is that i haven't included the texture n the material yet. We the were task to add a sky box which is the same method but the only difference is adding a skybox component to what i need to add the texture too. This is the result from what i was able to accomplish during the activity.

I wasnt able to get the ring on Saturn tho, i think there is a mask method but maybe it requires extra steps to get it working.

# Assignment 3 status

I was planning to make a scene where thr player has to go through 3 different encounters facing phobias: Deinophobia, Thalassophobia, Phasmophobia. This i think is quite ambitious as because it requires a lot of precisive coding and complex compositing in order to get it to work. The texture im planning is going to be different for the phobia, for the first one im going to have the texture has realistic as possible because dinosaurs are scary and low poly ones wont cut it out. For Thalassophobia i was planning to mix low poly and realistic beacuse water requires a lot of physics and coding. FInally for the last phobia im going to go fore an analog type style with low poly because the lower the quality the scarier the monster is. This is what im planning at first, things may change but i hope i could finish this ambitious project.

Thank you thats all for Week 7 session 1

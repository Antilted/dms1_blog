Week 2 session 1

My self portrait video will show “The steps of my journey” meaning that each scene will cut with me walking to different places. The video will also shows many places that ive been to just to get to know a city that ive never been to before. Aiming to give the audience a feeling of calmness and peacefulness while showing the nature and deep history of Melbourne

Week 2 session 2

Sounds: Chill and calm background music along with the raw and original sounds move the footages shot. 

Most of the clips shown in the video is raw which shows and gives a casual image of Melbourne and me. Editing using simple techniques while keeping the same vibe that gives a tone of feeling abstract. My shots are linked together by me appearing in some of them and the background that fits what is going to be shown next. In addition, some of the clips are going to have a different sound added since the background sounds are either too distorted or doesn’t fit. The video itself will contain clips in which some of the duration will last 6-8 seconds for each clip. There will diegetic and non-diegetic sounds in the video, there would also be a few materialization and sychrinization in the video for instance the first few clips, the footsteps, etc.

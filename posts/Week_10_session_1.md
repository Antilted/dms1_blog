# Introduction

Today we were presented with a new yet oddly familiar web based design program which is Figma. We did not get into Figma in the class too much this time but more rather than answering or planning the answers and questions for our web. In this lesson a bunch of self reflection questions were handed out and this is probably really setting us up for the final assingment.

# Reflection

By this i was taught how to reflect upon what i've done in my past work and how i view them now. I was tasked to peform a critical self reflection on my few lasts assingment and think about how i've done, what are the things that stand out and the mistakes that i wish i could improve on or rather fix. This is rather not unusual because i've been doing the blog which also counts as self-reflection so all the data or old work can be used and mentioned again in this assingment.

# Evaluating my work

Here Mr.Thomas talked us through how evaluating our own work or let others evaluate can really help widen our view about the elements in the work. This specific form of anylisis aims to help me improve my future projects as well as see the mistakes that might appeal to others and not to me. The best way to evaluate is to have someone else judge your work so they could point out what seems to be not right so that we could remove it or better refine the project.

# Assignment 1

Here i got a blast in the past with the first assignment and Mr.Thomas has prepared some questions so that we could answer but i would like just to go over everything as a brief because some things said might be repetitive and long.

How did you approach the relationship between sonic and visual components of your edit?

Basically i just planned out a specific and consistent vibe that goes thorughout in my video which is a calm and peacful vibe because when i first arrived in Melbourne everything seems to be very calm not much busy and noisy things happening at that time. Coming from that i basically chose and compose a few songs that screams chill and calm mood. As for the visual compoments basically i just try to get a good lighting in the scene and try to mix between a warm and cold tone.

The footage are also puposely filmed like a vlogging style to give the audience a sense of friendliness and amatuer from me yet this still gives out a good amount of information for the people watching my video. The footage are linked together through footsteps scenes as i want to showcase a meaning of the steps of my journey

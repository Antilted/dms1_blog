# Discussion

Sonic elemenents used in my video

Materialization: There is a clip of me pulling the luggae and the sound of the shoe as it makes contact with the ground that gives the audience a visual recognition of what the object without only relying on vision. In additon, theres the sound of crickets happening right before entering the scene with them that can give what the audience would expect.

Sychresis: There would be the background music matching the vibe of the video and sometimes even how the characters and objects that are moving in the footages.

Degetic sounds: In my clip some of the sounds would be like walking, door closing and the sounds of the trees and leaves crashing together matching the beats of the music.

Non-Diegetic: Background music playing setting the mood for what the audience sees

Reactive attention: Some of my scenes have animal especially the frogs making sounds and catching the viewers attention also there are some face pace walking cuts that can leave an impression of going to another place.

Volitional attention: Most of the footages in my video are slow pace and clam scenes that happen slowly most likey using fading transitons.

# Introduction

Today not much theory and lecture was talked about but instead Mr.Thomas introduced us to Figma which is quite a niche and simple web design program. Here we were taught about the basic tools and how to setup a frame so that we could later make a prototype of our web. I was thinking that this would be a fair assingment for all of us after the really harsh Unity one because is a web based design program so the tools and fundamentals shouldn't be too hard to master.

# Interface

My first impression when i first opened Figma is that the interface is quite minimalistic, what i mean is that everything is simple to follow. There was the hierarchy panel on the left side similar to Unity's one and the layer panel in Illustrator and theres the design tab on the right which contains the general design like color changing, scale, effects, etc. There's also a prototype panel in it which helps us link elements in the frame together. Finally theres a tool bar located at the bottom of the screen, it gives us access to simple things like shapes, frames, pen tool and so on.

# Hierarchy

This panel is simply just for us to see what there is that we have created and allows us to change the order of the layout. We could use the this to group and frame things also theres a component or asset panel that we could create a component and then could just add them in from the assets panel which i think is quite conveinient. 

# Tool bar

Here the tool bar has someone of basic and crucial tools especially the wireframe which provides us with a platform or main background that we could design the web on and see it in preview. Theres also the shape tool and pen tool which is really familiar as they're in every design app

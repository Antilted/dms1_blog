# Introduction

As usual the final classes are used for each students to take a look into each other's web and give some feedback. This is the Final class of the semester and I hope i did well in the past few months.

# Other's work

I didn't got the chance to look at other people web design but I a look at Mopa's and An's one. For Mopa's he did a really bright style colored style with clear information that i really like. For An she really made her web look so unique and it has carefully documented everything of her journey.

# Assingment 4 status

I just realized that everything needs to be in a single scrolling format so I basically just copy paste all of the components into a single frame and the jobs done.

Thats all for today

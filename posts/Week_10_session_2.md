# Introduction

Today not much theory and lecture was talked about but instead Mr.Thomas introduced us to Figma which is quite a niche and simple web design program. Here we were taught about the basic tools and how to setup a frame so that we could later make a prototype of our web. I was thinking that this would be a fair assingment for all of us after the really harsh Unity one because is a web based design program so the tools and fundamentals shouldn't be too hard to master.

# Interface

My first impression when i first opened Figma is that the interface is quite minimalistic, what i mean is that everything is simple to follow. There was the hierarchy panel on the left side similar to Unity's one and the layer panel in Illustrator and theres the design tab on the right which contains the general design like color changing, scale, effects, etc. There's also a prototype panel in it which helps us link elements in the frame together. Finally theres a tool bar located at the bottom of the screen, it gives us access to simple things like shapes, frames, pen tool and so on.

# Hierarchy

This panel is simply just for us to see what there is that we have created and allows us to change the order of the layout. We could use the this to group and frame things also theres a component or asset panel that we could create a component and then could just add them in from the assets panel which i think is quite conveinient.

# Tool bar

Here the tool bar has someone of basic and crucial tools especially the wireframe which provides us with a platform or main background that we could design the web on and see it in preview. Theres also the shape tool and pen tool which is really familiar as they're in every design app

# Design 

Here this is where we can change the properties of the components that is in the frame. It's really basic with just color changing, merging components, simple effect, etc. After seeing them I think that Figma is not intimidating at all rather it's just like your standard free design app.

# Assignment 4 status

Right now i've decided on a minimalistic theme and Im not planning to go with a crazy amount of technicality and effects for this one because I have to do a desktop and mobile version. I've sorted out for my bio, since Im better and worked with motion design and vfx more so I think i should include that in the introduction part of my biography. I was thinking something like: "Hi my name is Alan, im currently a graphic design student at RMIT Melbourne. Iâ€™ve got some experience with different design programs and apps. I mostly specialize in motion graphic and VFX compositing but i have also tried banner designs, magazines, retouch, creative coding, game designing, etc". 

Thats all for today,
Alan
